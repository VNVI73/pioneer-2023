# I wrote this code for a research project of mine: "A Qualitative Comparison of the Fast Fourier Transform and the Morlet Wavelet Transform for Potential Depression Diagnosis Using Resting-State Electroencephalographic Data"
# The purpose of this code is to analyze pre-processed EEG data with both Fourier transforms and Morlet wavelet transforms, specifically looking at different frequency bands, and to then output a topoplot
# The code requires the installment of the Fieldtrip and EEGLAB toolboxes in the MATLAB software
# Feel free to use this code for your own non-commercial projects
